Week 5 Lab: Microblogs!
=========

* Users can signup, and sign in
* User can follow other users
* User can see posts from [User + Friends] in their Timeline
* User can Post posts
* User can unfollow a person
* User can view a profile (/users/jwo)
* Site should look nice
* Posts should be paginated
* Use Faker to generate People and Posts (faker is optional)

### Extra

* Search for posts
* No N+1
* People can put the URL of a picture in for their picture and it will be shown
  on their profile. Or even better, use Identicons
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon). You can have another site create
  them (https://github.com/cupcake/sigil) or make them yourself
  (https://rubygems.org/gems/identicon).


### Deets

* When logged in, the root URL should show the messages from all the people you
  follow.
* People can post "messages," "cheeps," or whatever you want to call them.
  They're tweets, but please don't call them that.
